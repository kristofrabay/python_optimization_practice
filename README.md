# python practise
- trying out different optimization packages for Py
- pandas practise file
- unsupervised models (PCA, kmeans)
- supervised ML models (DecisionTree, RandomForest, GradientBoosting Classifiers, LogisticRegression)
- supervised DL model (neural net via Keras API)
- text generation + scraper for text **dummy model (@25% acc) output printed. ~90% acc prints comprehensible text but learns too much actual text. ~50% acc model should be smart-dumb enough**
